            The requirements for a Robotics and Embedded Systems major
        </h2>
        1. Design and complete robotic and embedded systems solutions that apply to 
            real-world situations and challenges.
        <br>
        <h3>Project 1 - create a DOM to share and update a table of space launch data</h3>
        <p>
            This will be a paragraph describe the table generation and updating so anyone 
                reading the boards page will be able to understand the project.
        </p>

        2. Implement a simple microprocessor using digital logic design.
        <br>
        <br>
        3. Demonstrate embedded system design skills, including, but not limited to, microcontroller selection, schematic design,
            printed circuit board layout, design for electromagnetic compatibility and design for manufacturing.
        <br>
        <br>
        4. Apply knowledge of transducers, actuators and simultaneous hardware and software development in the design of an
            embedded system.
        <br>
        <br>
        5. Design and analyze real-time embedded systems, including advanced digital logic design, signal processing and highspeed digital systems.
        <br>
        <br>
        6. Implement and evaluate algorithms and methods enabling autonomy in a mobile robot.
